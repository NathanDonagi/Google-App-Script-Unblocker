Code is split between server side and Google App Script code. Server side is idealy run on a vps, can be run on Repli.it but be warned it is againt their TOS and is NOT RECOMENDED NOR ENDORSED. 

As a fork of alloy proxy if functions in much the same way: it intercepts every request sent from a user, and proxies them to the website that is being “unblocked” while appearing to a naive web filter as being allowed traffic and appearing to the server on the other end as a normal user. However it is unique in that it proxies requests twice, first to a google app script server, then to a custom server I am running, before reaching the end destination.

This allows all of a users web requests to be sent to a google.com domain which look normal for a user on a google doc in which this is embeded instead of some shady random server. In order to proxy requests through google app scripts fetch and xml open had to be rewritten from scratch following the spec. I highlight my rewrite of window.fetch in the file [Google App Script Code/inject.js](https://github.com/NathanDonagi/Google-App-Script-Unblocker/blob/main/Google%20App%20Script%20Code/inject.js) in lines 267-288
